Title
: Multidimensional Visualization

Abstract
: Multidimensional visualization is one of the core topics of visualization research. It deals with basic problems of data analysis in visualization and many other disciplines. Despite the long history of work in multidimensional visualization, it is still a striving field with much ongoing progress and many connections to various applications. This talk starts with a brief overview and some theoretical considerations. Then, I illustrate recent advancements, with a focus on presenting results from my own work. In particular, I cover basic visual representations in the form of scatterplots, scatterplot matrices, and parallel coordinates. These are then combined with further analytical support, including dimensionality reduction, local correlation analysis, machine learning, and interactive exploration for visual analytics. I also discuss how multidimensional visualization can serve as a link between information visualization and scientific visualzation, and how it can be extended to include uncertainty visualization. The talk closes with an outlook on future research directions.

Bio
: Daniel Weiskopf is a professor and one of the directors of the Visualization Research Center (VISUS) and acting director of the Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), both at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. He received his Dr. rer. nat. (PhD) degree in physics from the University of Tübingen, Germany (2001), and the Habilitation degree in computer science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany (2005). His research interests include visualization, visual analytics, eye tracking, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, augmented and virtual reality, and special and general relativity. He is spokesperson of the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center SFB/Transregio 161 "Quantitative Methods for Visual Computing" (www.sfbtrr161.de), which covers basic research on visualization, including multidimensional visualization.

Title
: When Visualization Meets Privacy

Abstract
:  Nowadays, privacy preservation is an urgent demand for data-driven applications. Meanwhile, visualization is highly regarded owing to its power in exploring and understanding big data. What happens when visualization meets privacy? First, privacy leakage may appear in visualization and visual analytics processes. Examples include inappropriate presentation of sensitive data, unexpected data exchange for proprietary data sources, and inference of original values with external knowledge and correlations. On the other hand, there has been a growing need for understanding vulnerabilities in data privacy as well as evaluating and customizing task-specific privacy-preserving strategies, where visualization plays a critical role for domain experts. In this talk, I will discuss how we can mitigate the risk of leaking sensitive information in visualizations and how visualization and visual analytics can assist privacy preservation. Along the way, I will also discuss emerging challenges and opportunities in the meeting of visualization and privacy.

Bio
: Wei Chen is a professor in State Key Lab of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University, P.R.China. His current research interests include visualization, visual analytics and bio-medical image computing. He has performed research in visualization and visual analysis and published more than 70 IEEE/ACM Transactions and IEEE VIS papers. His chinese books on visualization are the unique books on visualization in China. He actively served in many leading conferences and journals, like IEEE PacificVIS steering committee, ChinaVIS steering committee, paper co-chairs of IEEE VIS, IEEE PacificVIS, IEEE LDAV and ACM SIGGRAPH Asia VisSym. He is an associate editor of IEEE TVCG, IEEE TBG, ACM TIST, IEEE CG&A, FCS, Visual Informatics and JOV.
